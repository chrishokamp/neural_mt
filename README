*Here Define Image and Moduli instalation*

    We installed an image Vasco Pinho found, we need to aks the details

    Here Ramon's steps following Chris code

* Running the training NMT system*

How I scrapped the code

    cd /home/ubuntu/NeuralMT/FuelBlocks/blocks-examples
    cp -R machine_translation/ /home/ubuntu/NeuralMT/neural_mt/

Actually copied from the other repo

    cp -R data/ /home/ubuntu/NeuralMT/neural_mt/ 

but his seemeed to work

    cd /home/ubuntu/NeuralMT/neural_mt/
    ./machine_translation/prepare_data.py

now testing

   cd /home/ubuntu/NeuralMT/neural_mt/
   THEANO_FLAGS='device=gpu1' python -m machine_translation
