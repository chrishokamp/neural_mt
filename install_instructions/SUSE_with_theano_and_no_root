# Installing into a machine with existing theano install and no root

**Important:** The machine needs to have HDF5 installed, otherwise it wont
work. There are instructions online for local HDF5 install but I could not make
the work (I did not try too hard)

Use virtualenv over the pre-existing instalation 

    virtualenv venv --system-site-packages

**DANGER** As in the Anaconda case, this seem to update at least part o the
existing theano instalation in the system

Install bleeding edge theano

    git clone git://github.com/Theano/Theano.git
    cd Theano
    python setup.py develop --user
    cd ..

Install Blocks

    pip install git+git://github.com/mila-udem/blocks.git \
    -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mila-udem/blocks/master/requirements.txt

    pip install git+git://github.com/mila-udem/blocks.git \
        -r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mila-udem/blocks/master/requirements.txt --upgrade

Modify *optimizer* and *on_unused_input* in ~/.theanorc as in the AWS case

    [global]
    optimizer = fast_compile
    on_unused_input = warn
    
    [lib]
    # This will reserve 90% of GPU's memory
    cnmem = 0.9

To use the GPU you need to specify where the CUDA is. I did this in the
~/.bashrc although the ~/.theanorc will work as well. In ~/.basrc write

    export THEANO_FLAGS='cuda.root=/usr/local/cuda/,device=gpu,floatX=float32'

Note that *device*, selects the gpu to be used. Bear in mind other users!.
